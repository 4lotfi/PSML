# Data Processing for Simulation
Here we describe how to process the original load consumption, weather, wind and solar time series data into the ready-for-simulation format.

## Prerequisite


## Processing Details
- Before running codes, make sure the data and save paths are consistent with your downloaded data. 
- Run codes step by step, which is indicated by the name of each code file.
- The obatined results should be the same as shown in the `Minute-level Load and Renewable` folder shared in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5130612#.YTIiZI5KiUk).
